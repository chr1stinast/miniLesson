    <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library thatâ€™s purpose is to make writing code easier and faster.
        It contains methods that have prewritten code so the user does not have to repeat the same code.
        Although nothing changes when you run the program, it makes the code itself cleaner and overall easier to write and read.
